description: "Second version of robust app-of-apps chart. this chart creates multiple argocd applications resources.
  It supports multiple chart instances of the same actual chart. If you want multiple kinds of chart, you can add 'kind' value to each chart section in the values.yaml.
  For example: add two chart sections to values.yaml sftp-file-manager-dap & sftp-file-manager-supplier,
  to dap section add field 'kind: dap' and to supplier section add field 'kind: supplier', this will lead to a result where there is 2 deployments of sftp-file-manager.
  This version also support changing helm chart values. For example: add 'parameter' field to chart section in values.yaml:
  parameters:
  - name: .change.this.value
    value: new_value"

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.3.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
